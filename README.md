# Zycore - Platform-independent types, macros, and fallbacks for environments without libc.

This is a [`build2`](https://build2.org/) package repository for [`zycore-c`](https://github.com/zyantific/zycore-c).

This file contains setup instructions and other details that are more appropriate for development rather than consumption. If you want to use [`zycore`](https://github.com/zyantific/zycore-c) in your [`build2`](https://build2.org/)-based project, then instead see the accompanying [`PACKAGE-README.md`](libzycore/PACKAGE-README.md) file.

The development setup for [`zycore`](https://github.com/zyantific/zycore-c) uses the standard [`bdep`](https://build2.org/bdep/doc/bdep.xhtml)-based workflow. For example:

```
git clone .../zycore.git
cd zycore

bdep init -C @gcc cc config.cxx=g++
bdep update
bdep test
```
