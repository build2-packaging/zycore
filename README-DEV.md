Building without libc is still considered experimental upstream and is not currently in a usable or buildable state. As such, this configuration is deliberately unsupported at this time.

note that zycore build options, such as forced assertions, are intended strictly for upstream development and are also not supported. Nevertheless, this position is not final; if you have a compelling use case for enabling such options, feel free to contact the current maintainer or submit a pull request for consideration.
